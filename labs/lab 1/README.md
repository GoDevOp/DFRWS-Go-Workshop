## Description

In Windows, a `FILETIME` is a 64-bit value that represents the number of 100-nanosecond intervals that have elapsed since 12:00 A.M. January 1, 1601 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

In Go, a `time.Time` represents an instant in time with nanosecond precision.

In this lab you will create a new package called `timestamp`, which contains the following defined `FileTime` type.  You must implement all methods as defined by the documentation below.

#### type FileTime

```go
type FileTime int64
```

FileTime is a 64-bit value that represents the number of 100-nanosecond

Universal Time (UTC).

#### func (FileTime) Time

```go
func (t FileTime) Time() time.Time
```
Time returns t as a standard time.Time

#### func  ToFileTime
